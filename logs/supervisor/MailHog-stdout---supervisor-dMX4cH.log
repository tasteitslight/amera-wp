Next, visit the page where the error was caught (http://amera.local/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php) and check for any visible issues.\r\n\r\nPlease contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further.\r\n\r\nIf your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further.\r\n\r\nhttp://amera.local/login/?action=enter_recovery_mode\u0026rm_token=OJCWz3bXxTCSsRe0yNxFfD\u0026rm_key=mJTUouO6u4dwkxVMlM2OoI\r\n\r\nTo keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nError Details\r\n=============\r\nAn error of type E_COMPILE_ERROR was caused in line 280 of the file /app/public/wp-content/themes/amera/functions.php. Error message: Cannot redeclare ajax_login() (previously declared in /app/public/wp-content/themes/amera/functions.php:219)\r\n",

Next, visit the page where the error was caught (http://amera.local/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php) and check for any visible issues.\r\n\r\nPlease contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further.\r\n\r\nIf your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further.\r\n\r\nhttp://amera.local/login/?action=enter_recovery_mode\u0026rm_token=OJCWz3bXxTCSsRe0yNxFfD\u0026rm_key=mJTUouO6u4dwkxVMlM2OoI\r\n\r\nTo keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nError Details\r\n=============\r\nAn error of type E_COMPILE_ERROR was caused in line 280 of the file /app/public/wp-content/themes/amera/functions.php. Error message: Cannot redeclare ajax_login() (previously declared in /app/public/wp-content/themes/amera/functions.php:219)\r\n",
