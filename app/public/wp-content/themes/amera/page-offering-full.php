                  The AAAmerican Opportunity Fund seeks to acquire high-quality real estate properties located in designated Opportunity Zones that have strong long-term growth potential. The Fund intends to meet the requirements necessary to qualify as an Opportunity Fund as defined in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in order to avail investors of the substantial tax-related benefits provided under the bill.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Fund is managed by American Group, wholly owned subsidiary of American Consolidated, Inc. As of 2019, American Group, as a sponsor, has originated and invested in real estate with an aggregate purchase price of over $1 billion, and has managed ten proprietary real estate investment vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Fund anticipates an investment term of no less than 10 years in order to capture the full tax benefits offered under the tax code for Opportunity Funds.
                </p>

                  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created significant tax benefits to encourage long-term investments in low-income urban and rural communities. These benefits include permanent exclusion from taxable income if the investment is held for at least 10 years, and deferrment and reduction of due taxes for investors with qualifying capital gains. <a href="/tax-advantage">Learn more about Opportunity Fund benefits</a>

                <p>
                  Following the capital raise for its initial Opportunity Fund, a single asset vehicle, American Group heard from its investor community that many investors prefer to invest into diversified vehicles for a variety of reasons including mitigating concentration risks and providing tax-free dispursements for tax expense in 2027.

                <p class="mt-4">
                  The Fund’s investment goals are to provide investors with the ability to participate in a diversified range of real estate development or rehabilitation projects that will offer current cash flow, the opportunity for capital appreciation and to take advantage of the tax benefits offered by the Opportunity Zone Program.
                </p>
                <p>
                  American Group has qualified the most attractive opportunity zone markets based on recent demographic and economic growth. Specifically, the qualifying criteria for the most attractive opportunity zones are based on average household income, population and employment growth. Some of the most attractive opportunity zone markets according to our demographic and economic analysis are in Florida, Texas, and Virginia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Fund will generally target the most attractive opportunity zone markets that that demonstrate above-average urban population growth and offer a lower cost of living and lower cost of doing business relative to gateway cities such as New York or Los Angeles. American has been tracking these "secondary cities", measuring the growth of millennial population, influx of institutional capital and employment growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have identified target markets that are aligned with macroeconomic and demographic trends that we believe support excellent Opportunity Zone investments: above average growth in population, income and employment.
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/assets/img/svg/svg-usa-2.svg" />
                <p>
                When making an Investment, the Fund will emphasize the performance and risk characteristics of that Investment, how that Investment will fit with the Fund’s portfolio-level performance objectives, the other assets in its portfolio and how the returns and risks of that investment compared to the returns and risks of available Investment alternatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Fund will attempt to construct a portfolio that produces stable and attractive returns by spreading risk across different Investments. To the extent that American Group can meet with Qualified Opportunity Fund requirements under the Code, the Fund’s portfolio composition may vary from what it initially expects. 
                </p>
                <p>
                American Group maintains discretion concerning the selection of specific Investments. In selecting a potential Investment, the American Group real estate experts will consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

                    The preceding summary of principal terms of this offering is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more complete information about the offering contained in the offering documents, including, without limitation, the Investment Opportunity summary LLC Agreement of the Fund, the Subscription Booklet, and all exhibits and other documents attached thereto or referenced therein (collectively, the "Investment Documents"). This summary is not complete, and each prospective investor should carefully read all of the Investment Documents and any supplements thereto, copies of which are available by clicking the links above or upon request, before deciding whether to make an investment.

The Fund will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other U.S. or non-U.S. securities commission or regulatory authority has passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this document or approved or disapproved of the investment described therein. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. Neither the Manager nor any of its affiliates is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (as amended). Under the Securities Laws, the interests in the Fund may not be sold, pledged or transferred unless a registration statement is in effect or unless an exemption from registration is available. In addition, the interests in the Fund are subject to restrictions on transferability contained in the LLC Agreement. Interests in the Fund will be sold only to persons or entities that qualify as “accredited investors” as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder. An investment in the securities described above involves certain risks, some of which are described in Exhibit B of the Subscription Booklet.

                  <li>
                    Neither the Fund nor the Manager or any of their affiliates makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained above and nothing contained above shall be relied upon as a promise or representation whether as to the past or future performance. The information above includes targets, estimates, approximates and projections and involves significant elements of subjective judgment and analysis. No representations are made as to the accuracy of such targets, estimates, approximates or projections or that such targets, estimates, approximates or projections will be realized. The information contained above does not purport to contain all of the information that may be required to evaluate an investment in the Fund and you must read the LLC Agreement of the Fund and the Subscription Booklet, and should conduct your own independent analysis of the data referred to above prior to making an investment in the Fund. Neither the Fund nor the Manager expects to update or otherwise revise the information contained above. All information contained above, including any targets, estimates, approximates or projections, is based upon information internally provided by affiliates of the Manager or third parties and has not been audited or otherwise independently verified. Certain of the economic and financial market information contained above has been obtained from published sources and/or prepared by other parties. While such sources are believed to be reliable, none of the Fund, the Manager, their affiliates or any other person assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information, and no representation or warranty is made with respect thereto. Additional information from the Manager is available on request.

                  <li>
                  The information above contains statements that are not purely historical in nature, but are “forward-looking statements.” These include, among other things, targeted performance, projections, forecasts and estimates of return performance. The Manager believes that there is a sound basis for the targeted performance of the Fund. These forward-looking statements are based upon certain assumptions. Actual events are difficult to predict and may be beyond the Fund’s control. Actual events may differ from those assumed. All forward-looking statements included are based on information available on the date hereof and neither the Fund nor the Manager or their respective affiliates assume any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Some important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in economic conditions, political changes, legal and regulatory requirements, exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in the markets, prospects, competition or consumer preferences, among others. Other risk factors are also identified in Exhibit B of the Subscription Booklet. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated returns or projections can be realized or that actual returns or results will not be materially lower than those calculated.
                  In considering any performance data contained above, you should bear in mind that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve comparable results.

                  Prospective investors should make their own investigations and evaluations of the information contained above. Prior to the sale of interests in the Fund, the Manager will give investors the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of an investment in the Fund and other relevant matters and to obtain any additional information (to the extent that the Manager possesses such information or can obtain it without unreasonable effort or expense) necessary to verify the accuracy of the information in the Investment Documents. Each prospective investor should consult its own attorney, business adviser and tax adviser as to legal, business, tax and related matters concerning the information contained above including the merits and risks involved with an investment in the Fund. Investment in the limited partnership interests of the Fund involves a high degree of risk due, among other things, the nature of the Fund’s investments. Investment in the Fund is suitable only for sophisticated investors and requires the financial ability and willingness to accept the high risks and lack of liquidity inherent in an investment in the Fund. Investors in the Fund must be prepared to bear such risks for an indefinite period of time. No assurance can be given that the Fund’s investment objective will be achieved or that investors will receive a return of their capital.

                  The OZ rules provide that in the case of real property (other than unimproved land) that is leased by a QOF, if at the time of lease there was a plan for the real property to be purchased by the QOF for an amount other than fair market value it will not be qualified opportunity zone business property. The Sponsor has indicated that the lease agreement will include a provision modifying the purchase price of the land to "Fair Market Value" in the event in the opinion of Lessee’s tax counsel the purchase price payable would be deemed greater than the “Fair Market Value” of such real property, thereby jeopardizing the qualification of the subject land as Qualified Opportunity Zone Business Property and causing the Lessee to fail to qualify as a Qualified Opportunity Zone Business.
