          All Users: Consent to Electronic Transactions and Disclosures
        </h4>
        <div class="separator-gradient mb-3"></div>
        <p>
          The decision to do business with American Group and our affiliates electronically is yours. This document informs you of your rights concerning Disclosures. Because American Group operates only on the Internet, it is necessary for you to consent to transact business with us online and electronically.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of doing business with American Group and our affiliates, you must also consent to our giving you certain disclosures electronically, either via our Site or to the e-mail address you provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          By agreeing to the Terms of Service, you agree to receive electronically all documents, communications, notices, contracts, and agreements, (including any IRS Forms, IRS Form 1099, Form K-1) or other tax forms, schedules or information statements, arising from or relating to your registration as an investor on our Site, any investments you may make, your use of this service, and the servicing of any investment and any notes you have purchased (each, a “Disclosure”), as either an investor of American Group, whether we are acting in the capacity as trustee or otherwise, or our affiliates.
        </p>
        <p>
          An “IRS Form 1099” refers to any Form 1099 or other Form, Schedule or information statement, including corrections of such documents, required to be provided pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations and that may be provided electronically (each, an “IRS Form 1099”). 
        </p>

        </h4>
        <div class="separator-gradient mb-3"></div>
        <p>
          Any disclosures will be provided to you electronically through American Group either on our Site or via electronic mail to the verified email address you provided. If you require paper copies of such Disclosures, you may write to us at the mailing address provided below and a paper copy will be sent to you at a cost of up to $25.00. A request for a paper copy of any Disclosure will not be considered a withdrawal of your consent to receive Disclosures electronically. Any IRS 1099 Forms provided electronically will remain accessible through at least October 15 of the year in which such IRS Form 1099 is made available; after that time the IRS Form 1099 may no longer be accessible electronically. We may discontinue electronic provision of Disclosures at any time in our sole discretion.
        </p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">

        <div class="separator-gradient mb-3"></div>
        <p>
          Your consent to receive disclosures and transact business electronically, and our agreements to do so, applies to any transactions to which such disclosures relate, whether between you and American Group or between you and our affiliates. Your consent will remain in effect for so long as you are a user and, if you are no longer a user, will continue until such a time as all disclosures relevant to transactions that occurred while you were a user have been made.
        </p>

        </h4>
        <div class="separator-gradient mb-3"></div>

        <p>
          American Group generally receives all payments, and makes all disbursements, through electronic funds transfers (ACH transfers) using the bank (or other financial institution) account information you provide to us. You authorize such bank or other financial account to pay any amounts described herein, and authorize American Group to make any and all investment disbursements, to such account. You agree to provide American Group updated information regarding your bank or other account upon American Group’s request and at any time that the information earlier provided is no longer valid.

          If you are accessing our Site and the disclosures electronically via a mobile device (such as a smart phone, tablet, and the like), in addition to the above requirements you must make sure that you have software on your mobile device that allows you to print and save the disclosures presented to you during the application process. These applications can be found for most mobile devices in the device’s respective “app store.” If you do not have these capabilities on your mobile device, please access our site through a device that provides these capabilities.

        <div class="separator-gradient mb-3"></div>
        <p>
          Investor registration will require you to provide basic personal data. Such information typically includes your name, email address, home address and phone number, date of birth, social security number and/or tax identification number. American Group uses this data to: (i) enable you to log in to the Site; (ii) establish your ability to view offering materials and to make investments through the Site (iii) verify that you are at least 18 years of age; (iv) guard against potential fraud; (v) contact you if there is a problem with your account; and (vi) maintain regular communications with you as may be necessary to inform you of upcoming investment opportunities and other company updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Group will also gather the names and email addresses of users who contact us through the Site with questions about our company. We collect this information for the sole purpose of responding to such inquiries and do not store the contact information unless requested to do so, as in the case of job applicants who submit resumes.

          American Group will send you email notifications from time to time. Some notifications are required elements of your transactions on our platform, such as confirmations of particular actions you have taken. These mandatory notices are sent typically to notify you of a change in status. For example, you will receive a notice when you are confirmed as an investor.

          We also send out notices that are required for legal or security purposes. For example, certain notifications are sent for your own protection to ensure that another person cannot make a change to your account without your knowledge. In other cases, these notifications involve changes to various legal agreements or Site policies. Generally, you may not opt out of such service-related emails.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you register as an investor, you will receive emails that confirm specific actions you requested. These will include emails to which you must respond to complete your registration and notifications confirming your registration. Thereafter, you will receive emails when a new investment opportunity is offered, as well as updates concerning the progress of the funding of such offering and/or other relevant information. If you make an investment through the Site, American Group will also send you confirmations of the investment as well as occasional updates as to the status of that investment and the timing of distributions relating to that investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also send you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate. From time to time, we will also send user surveys, requests for user feedback regarding user experience and Site operations, or marketing offers from us or from us on behalf of our marketing partners. Completing these surveys, answering requests for feedback, or accepting any offer is strictly voluntary. If you do not wish to receive these surveys, user feedback emails, and/or marketing offers, please opt out in any offer email you receive from us.
